    // Let's say we have an array

    const teams = players;

    console.log(players, teams);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    teams[3] = "lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, teams);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const teams2 = players.slice();
    teams2[2] = "sun";
    console.log(teams2, players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teams3 = [].concat(players);
    teams3[1] = "moon"
    console.log(teams3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teams4 = [...players];
    teams4[1] = "buoy"
    console.log(teams4, players);

    const teams5 = Array.from(players);
    teams5[1] = "five"
    console.log(teams5, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };


    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99
    console.log(captain);    
    console.log(person);    

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 50});
    console.log(capt2);    
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

//this works as this is just 1 level
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = "wesley";
    console.log(dev);
    console.log(wes);

    //this doesnt work because it is 2 levels, both are changed
    dev.social.twitter = "@coolman";
    console.log(dev.social);
    console.log(wes.social);

    // to overcome this we use a function called clone deep. instead of that we can also use 
    // the following which is much simpler
